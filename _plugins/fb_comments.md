The FB Comments plugin allows you to add Facebook comments to some pages of your site.

This plugin allows you to specify which pages should feature comments by using a metadata field, and allows you to place your comments wherever you'd like in your theme file.

This plugin is part of [bigicoin](https://github.com/bigicoin)'s [PicoMiscPlugins](https://github.com/bigicoin/PicoMiscPlugins) repo.  Although these plugins share a [readme](https://github.com/bigicoin/PicoMiscPlugins/blob/master/README.md), they can be installed independently of each other.
