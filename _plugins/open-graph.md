Adds the proper open graph attributes for social network sharing.

The Open graph `og:type`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url`, and `og:site_name` values are determined automatically using your page/site's metadata.

The `og:image` value is defined using a custom field in your page's metadata.  This lets you define a custom image that appears next to your links when sharing on a social network.

This plugin is part of [bigicoin](https://github.com/bigicoin)'s [PicoMiscPlugins](https://github.com/bigicoin/PicoMiscPlugins) repo.  Although these plugins share a [readme](https://github.com/bigicoin/PicoMiscPlugins/blob/master/README.md), they can be installed independently of each other.
