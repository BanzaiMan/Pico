Migrating your site?  Whether you're coming from a static site, or another CMS, this plugin can help redirect your old URLs.

Most CMS's have their own URL formatting style (e.g. /folder/page.html), that you might not want to bring to your new site.  Don't lose traffic to those old URLs, make them redirect to their new homes!

This plugin is part of [bigicoin](https://github.com/bigicoin)'s [PicoMiscPlugins](https://github.com/bigicoin/PicoMiscPlugins) repo.  Although these plugins share a [readme](https://github.com/bigicoin/PicoMiscPlugins/blob/master/README.md), they can be installed independently of each other.
